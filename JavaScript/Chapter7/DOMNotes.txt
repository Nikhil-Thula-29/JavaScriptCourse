Whenever we load html it will load into browser ,loaded sucessfull browser engine will create object 
it is called document object or DOM object
Inside DOM we have tree structure like html tag is having two child nodes i.e head and body and that head is acting parent node for title,
in same way body is acting parent for h1 and h2 inside it is having data like tree structure.
HTML tag->root/parent node
head and body node children of html tag
title,h1,h2 are child nodes for head and body and html is the grand parent of those h2,h1,title
for ref see above structure.
HTML,TITLE,HEAD,BODY ARE nodes
Demo,Hello,Hellooooooo are node text
Changing h2 to h3 or any changing in dom is called dom manipulations or dom traverse.
